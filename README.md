### Notes

At the beginning of the development I started creating the core functionality of the game, modeling it and testing. There was a Game and a Board to separate reponsibilities, but then I realize that the Game was just a wrapper of the board that didn'tÂ´t have any functionality. I tried to keep the design as simple as possible, without so many layers of abstraction. On the other side, I used SpringBoot for the webserver because I just wanted to focus on the business logic and not lose my time on configurations, also knowing that then it was going to be easier for the deploy.

At first I was thinking in modeling the game with a Graph to avoid the knowledge of the existence of a Position but then I realize that I preferred the simple way of a flat matrix of objects because the rest of the interaction with the users would have to know about an X and Y. So a lot of parsers were gonna be needed without reason.

The other decision about modeling in the core was about the FLAG, at the beginning I started with a Boolean in the cell to know if that cell was flag or not, but then I saw that the flagged cell was having other behavior in some parts of the application, like when I need to print the value of a cell. So then I decided to change it to a decorator.

I would have liked to document it with https://www.openapis.org/ to make it easy for making the client side of the challenge, but I ran out of time so i decided to at least finish with the whole requirement of deployment and at least write the documentation in the MD.
